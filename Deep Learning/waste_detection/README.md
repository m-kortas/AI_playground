# Detect waste

AI4Good project for detecting waste in environment.
[www.detectwaste.ml](www.detectwaste.ml).

Our latest results are provided in
paper [Waste detection in Pomerania: non-profit project for detecting waste in environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06808)
.

Did you know that we produce 300 million tons of plastic every year? And only the part of it is properly recycled.

The idea of detect waste project is to use Artificial Intelligence to detect plastic waste in the environment. Our
solution is applicable for video and photography. Our goal is to use AI for Good.

# Implementation

A PyTorch FASTRCNN for detecting waste (
TorchVision https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html )

# Annotations

- annotations need to be in a csv file. It can be created with json_to_csv notebook.

# Datasets

In Detect Waste in Pomerania project we used 9 publicity available datasets, and additional data collected
using [Google Images Download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download).

For more details, about the data we used, check
our [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/wimlds-trojmiasto/detect-waste/tree/main/notebooks) with data exploratory
analysis.
